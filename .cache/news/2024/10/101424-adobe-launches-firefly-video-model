              <p><strong>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. – October 14, 2024 –</strong> Today, at <a href="https://max.adobe.com/">Adobe MAX</a> – the world’s largest creativity conference – Adobe (Nasdaq: ADBE) announced the expansion of its Firefly family of creative generative AI models to video, in addition to new breakthroughs in its Image, Vector and Design models and significant momentum in Firefly’s adoption by leading brands and enterprises. The <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/10/14/generate-video-beta-on-firefly-web-app">Firefly Video Model</a>, now in limited public beta, is the first publicly available video model designed to be commercially safe. Since Firefly’s first beta release in March 2023, it has been used to generate more than 13 billion images – an increase of more than 6 billion over the past six months.</p>
              <p>“The usage of Firefly within our creative applications has seen massive adoption, and it’s been inspiring to see how the creative community has used it to push the boundaries of what’s possible,” said Ely Greenfield, chief technology officer, digital media at Adobe. “We’re thrilled to bring creative professionals even more tools for ideation and creation, all designed to be commercially safe.”</p>
              <p><strong>New Firefly-powered Offerings</strong></p>
              <p>The Firefly Video Model (beta) extends Adobe’s family of generative AI models, which already includes an Image Model, Vector Model and Design Model, making Firefly the most comprehensive model offering for creative teams. It is available today through a limited public beta to garner initial feedback from a small group of creative professionals, which will be used to continue to refine and improve the model.</p>
              <p>Within one year of being launched, Firefly was brought into Photoshop, Express, Illustrator, Substance 3D and more, while supporting various workflows in Creative Cloud applications. Firefly also supports text prompts in over 100 languages and enables users around the world to create stunning content that is designed to be safe for commercial use.</p>
              <p>New Firefly offerings in Creative Cloud available today include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Generative Extend (beta) for perfectly timed video edits:</strong> Powered by the Firefly Video Model and now available in the Premiere Pro beta, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/10/14/generative-extend-in-premiere-pro">Generative Extend</a> allows you to extend clips to cover gaps in footage, smooth out transitions, or hold on shots longer for perfectly timed edits.</li>

              <p><strong>Driving Responsible Innovation with Adobe Firefly</strong></p>
              <p>Firefly powers generative AI tools designed for creative needs, use cases, and workflows. Adobe trained its <a href="https://www.adobe.com/ai/overview/firefly/gen-ai-commitments.html">Firefly generative AI models</a> on licensed content, such as Adobe Stock and public domain content. In addition, Adobe’s AI features are developed in accordance with the company’s <a href="https://www.adobe.com/ai/overview/ethics.html">AI Ethics principles</a> of accountability, responsibility, and transparency.</p>
              <p>Since founding the <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/#_blank">Content Authenticity Initiative</a> in 2019, Adobe has championed the widespread adoption of <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/%22%20/o%20%22https://contentcredentials.org/">Content Credentials</a> as the industry standard for transparency in digital content, now supported by over 3,700 members. Content Credentials, which act like a “nutrition label” for digital content to show how it was created and edited, are applied to select Firefly-powered features across Creative Cloud to indicate the use of generative AI.</p>
